My research interest is the **inner and outer interpretability of deep learning models**, where *inner* refers to the underlying theory for training the models and *outer* refers to unveiling the models' reason in producing the outputs.
Along this line, my works include:
* Inner and Outer interpretability in Dialogue Generation
* Science and Machine Learning
* Deep Reinforcement Learning and Generative Adversarial Nets

I'm currently a Computer Science PhD candidate at University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), working with professor [William Yang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/). Before that, I received BS degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University, where I worked with professor [Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) on speech processing, professor [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php) on generative adversarial nets and reinforcement learning, professor [Yun-Nung Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) on Conversational AI.
I have interned at Meta (Facebook) AI at 2023 (host by [Dan Bikel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=St5gv-4AAAAJ&hl=en)), 2022 (host by [Wenhan Xiong](https://xwhan.github.io/) and [Yashar Mehdad](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hFKgapkAAAAJ&hl=en)) and 2020 (host by [Ahmed El-Kishky](https://ahelk.github.io/) and [Paco Guzm√°n](https://guzmanhe.github.io/)), and Amazon Alexa AI (host by [Sajjad Beygi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_ZSfAa4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Marriam Fazel-Zarandi](https://www.maryamfazel.com/)) at 2021.

More details of me are in my [CV](my_original_webpage/Files/CV_20231019.pdf). Feel free to contact me via email.
