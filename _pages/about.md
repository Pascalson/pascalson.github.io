I'm a researcher of **machine learning algorithms**, specializing in **conversational AI, reinforcement learning, model interpretability**.
My research includes:
- Learning Algorithms to improve efficiency and efficacy: [Atom Modeling (2024)](#tuan2024dynamic), [Knowledge-Grounded Reinforcement Learning (2023)](#chiu2022knowledge), [Maximizing ATE (2022-2024)](#tuan2023causaldialogue)
- Reinforcement Learning with Learned Reward Models for Text Generation: [PPO for Text Generation (2018)](#tuan2018proximal), [Stepwise Rewarding GAN for Text Generation (2018)](#tuan2019improving), [Safety and Helpfulness Control (2024)](#tuan2024towards)
- Knowledge Augmented Chatbots: [Dynamic Knowledge Graph-Grounded Dialogue Model (2019)](#tuan2019dykgchat), [Differential Knowledge Graph Dialogue Model (2022)](#tuan2022towards), [Knowledge Injection (2020)](#tuan2020knowledge)
- Text Generative Model Explanation and Evaluation: [Language Model Generation Explanation (2021)](#tuan2021local), [Interpretable Knowledge Augmented Dialogue Model (2022)](#tuan2022towards), [Quality Estimation with Synthetic Data (2021)](#tuan2021quality)


I'm currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the **University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)**, working with Professor [William Yang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/).
I received a BS in Electrical Engineering from **National Taiwan University**, where I fortunately worked with professors [Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm), [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php), and [Yun-Nung Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) on language modeling, deep learning algorithms, and speech processing.
