Hi! I'm a PhD in Computer Science at the **University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)**, working with Professor [William Yang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/).
I received a BS in Electrical Engineering from **National Taiwan University**, where I fortunately worked with professors [Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm), [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php), and [Yun-Nung Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) on language modeling, deep learning algorithms, and speech processing.
I also enjoyed interning at Meta AI and Amazon Alexa AI on (L)LM fine-tuning, pretraining, reasoning, and evaluation.

I'm working on the **intersection of model expressiveness, interpretation, reinforcement learning, and language modeling**.
More details about me are in my [CV](./CV_20240314.pdf). Feel free to contact me via email.
