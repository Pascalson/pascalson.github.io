Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the **University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)**, working with Professor [William Yang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/).
I received a BS in Electrical Engineering from **National Taiwan University**, where I fortunately worked with professors [Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm), [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php), and [Yun-Nung Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) on language modeling, deep learning algorithms, and speech processing.
I also enjoyed interning at Meta AI and Amazon Alexa AI on (large) language models fine-tuning, pretraining, reasoning, and evaluation.

I'm researching the **learning algorithms to improve language modeling and conversational AI, including reinforcement learning, to enhance their efficiency, performance, interpretability, and the representations**.
Here is my [CV](./CV_20240425.pdf). Feel free to contact me via email.
